# undergrad_exercises
Exercises in C language build during my first year of undergraduate in Engineering. There's a short description in the beginning of each exercise explaining its purpose.
<br>The majority of the exercises are in Portuguese because it's my native language and all of them were built in Portuguese.
<br><br><b>I'm completely open to talk about any of them in English if needed.</b>
