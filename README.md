# undergrad_exercises
This repository aims to store code built during my engineering undergraduate years.

Here you'll find:
  - exercises in C language done during the first year of undergrad
  - scientific research in Python: kNN algorithm applied to optimize distribution logistics
  - undergraduate thesis in Python: artificial neural networks methodology implemented to help financial companies in the process of giving credits to individuals

<br>The majority of the code is in Portuguese because it's my native language and all of them were built in Portuguese.
<br><br><b>I'm completely open to talk about any of the exercises in English if needed.</b>
